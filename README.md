# SmrtNet: Predicting small molecule and RNA target interactions using deep neural network

RNA-targeting small molecules can bind RNA to regulate its function, providing a promising alternative approach for the treatment of human disease. However, the development of this field has been hindered by the lack of effective experimental probing and computational prediction approaches. Here, we present SmrtNet (Predicting small molecule and RNA target interactions using deep neural network), a deep learning-based framework designed to predict interactions between small molecules and RNA targets. SmrtNet extracts sequence and structural information from both small molecule and RNA target using large-scale language models and attention-based neural networks, and integrates mutual information among different encoders using a novel feature fusion strategy.
